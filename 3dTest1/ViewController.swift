        // By changing the plane node's eulerAngles property, you rotate the plane backwards 90 degrees along the x axis. We need to do this, because planes are created vertically by default. In SceneKit, rotation angles are calculated in radians rather than degrees, but these values can be easily converted using the GLKMathDegreesToRadians(_:) and GLKMathsRadiansToDegrees(_:) functions. GLK stands for GLKit, Apple's OpenGL framework.

Note that the value assigned does not have to be a UIColor object. There are many other acceptable object types to assign to this property, such as UIImage, CALayer, and even a SpriteKit texture (SKTexture).

        // To create the spot light, you first set the light's type to SCNLightTypeSpot. You then specify the spot light's inner and outer angles in degrees. The default values are 0 and 45 respectively. The inner angle determines how much area the light covers in direct light while the outer angle decides how much area is partially lit. The difference between these angles will become clear once you see the resulting scene. You then explicitly tell the light to cast shadows and also add the same SCNLookAtConstraint that you created for your camera earlier.
